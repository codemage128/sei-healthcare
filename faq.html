                <h1>FAQ</h1>
                <a class="underline" href="#">
                    <h4>PRODUCT</h4>
                </a>
                <h4 class="mt-4">What is the shelf life of Botanical Affairs products?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    Both our finished products and the raw materials have an unopened shelf life of at least 30 months.
                    In general, you can recognize the shelf life of a product by the symbol of the opened cream jar.
                    Everything that has a shelf life of more than 30 months before opening bears this symbol. Next to
                    the jar you will find a number. This number tells you how many months the product will keep after it
                    has been opened for the first time.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    If the products smell strange, feel odd on the skin or have an unusual consistency, simply contact
                    us.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">How long do I have to use the products?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    With regular use in combination with oil and sitz bath, you should feel significant relief of your
                    symptoms within 30 days. The length of time it takes to achieve lasting results varies from person
                    to person. Regular use for three months is often necessary to remain permanently symptom-free.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">How to apply the oil?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    The oil should be applied to the abdomen and lower back at least three times a day and massaged in
                    lightly.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">How to use the sitz bath?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    The bath salts should be placed in a bowl or container where you can sit and relax, such as a wash
                    bowl or bidet. The recommended amount of one tablespoon is limited to the use of a sitz bath. The
                    bath salts are not intended for a full bath, as it can lead to further inflammation due to possible
                    bacteria in the water.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">How to use the lubricant gel?</h4>
                <p class="mb-5 mt-2">
                    The gel can be used like a traditional lubricant during intimate moments with your partner, alone or
                    simply in between to moisturize and relieve local symptoms.
                </p>
                <a class="underline" href="#">
                    <h4>ORDER</h4>
                </a>
                <h4 class="mt-4">Can I return the products?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    You can exercise your right of cancellation within 14 days and withdraw from the purchase contract.
                    You can find out exactly how this works in the cancellation policy. To do this, please send us a
                    message via the contact form or an email to hello.botanical@gmail.com and then return the goods to
                    us. As soon as we have received the package and have checked your cancellation, we will refund the
                    money to the payment method you used for the order. If you paid by bank transfer, please send us
                    your bank account details. Unfortunately, we cannot cover the return costs.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">Can I add to or change my order?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    Unfortunately, this is logistically difficult because your package will be prepared for shipment
                    immediately after you place your order. However, if your order has not yet been packed, we can
                    cancel it completely and you can place your order again. The best way to do this is to quickly send
                    an email to hello.botanicals@gmail.com
                </p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">I need help. When and how can I best reach Botanical Affairs?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    You can reach us from Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. by phone at 089 69 31 39 555 or by

                    <h4>SHIPPING AND RETURNS</h4>
                </a>
                <h4 class="mt-4">Can you really eat the packaging material?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    The packaging material is made of pea or maize starch, so you can actually eat it. However, if you
                    don't like it, it's best to dispose of it in the organic waste bin or dissolve it in water to water
                    your flowers. The material makes a fantastic plant fertilizer!
                </p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">How will my order be shipped?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    We ship climate neutrally with DHL Go Green. The emissions generated during transport are
                    neutralized 100% without any additional costs for you as a customer! You can find more information

                </p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">My parcel is in a post office - and I can't fetch it!</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    If you are unable to collect your parcel from the post office within the storage period of seven

                </p>
                <h4 class="mt-4">How can I track the shipment of my order?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 mt-2">
                    You can do this simply by clicking on the DHL tracking link, which will be sent to your e-mail
